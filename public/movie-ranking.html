<h2>Violet Evergarden</h2>
One of my all time favorite shows due to its philosophilcal exploration of all the differnt emotions a human being can feel throught their life and how to treasure the passing of time.

<h2>Hyouka</h2>
The anime which I relate to the most where most of my character and personality took inspiration from the main character of this show. It dives into the complex human relationships between people friends and family wand their dynamics and how it affects their life. They do this by following a mystery-detective show with a slight hint of romance and comedy which makes the show so much more precious and enjoyable. Definetly worth the watch.

<h2>Attack on Titan</h2>
I would honestly rate this as one of the best pieces of fiction ever written. The amazing world building, the ever so flawed but well written characters, the impeccable pacing of the story, the mind blowing plot twist, this show has everything packed into it and it keeps everyone who watches it at the edge of their seats. Everyone should check this out atleast once in their lifetime.
